		<p>GitHub is our primary tool to track your progress in your programming assignments. Your instructors, being former students, understand the temptation to procrastinate. However you will not be able to absorb all the complexities of each project without beginning the learning process as soon as possible. For this reason I want to see you doing some work at the beginning of each topic week (Friday-Thursday). I hope this practice will encourage you to develop a good workflow so you can be as successful as possible in school and your future career. The MDV program has decided as a group that Twenty Professionalism points will be deducted each week if you have not made a meaningful commit by Monday night at 11:59PM.</p>
